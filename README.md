# DESI_SV

Repository with useful notebooks in the analysis of VI files. This repository is constantly being updated. The notebooks here will make the following tasks easier:

 * Comparing VI files across users.
 * Comparing VI files with the results of the simulation (for VI on simulated datasets only).
 * Merging VI files for construction of SV0 truth tables.
 * Analysis of truth tables and isolating/inspecting problematic cases.

This is also where we will keep a record of the merging process for the various truth tables.

Almost all of the notebooks make use of Prospect to inspect spectra on the fly.
